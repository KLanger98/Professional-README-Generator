  ## Description

  The motivation for this project was to practice creating a Node.js backend application which could be initiated from the command line to complete a task. The selected task was to generate a README.md file from a series of prompts in the command line. 

  I built this project as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development Bootcamp. It allowed me to explore the functionality of Node.js and incorporate node package modules such as Inquirer to assist with prompting. Overall, this project has been a great introduction to backend programming with Node.js.

  This project seeks to solve the problem of having to write out some of the sometimes tedious details of a professional README.md file. By using this application you no longer need to rely on any copy paste templates as the command line will prompt you with specific questions, taking your answers and constructing a README.md file.

  During the creation of this project I learnt the basics of Node.js, the backend and integrating applications for the backend. It has been especially useful to learn how to use Inquirer's prompts to ask the user questions on the command line and to use the provided information to write and append to files. I have also learnt some more in-depth details about what constitutes a professional README.md file which is always useful.

  ## Installation

  To install this project, simply clone the repository to your local computer.

  ## Usage

  In order to use this project. Navigate to the cloned repository in the command line and execute the index.js file with the command "node index.js". You will then be prompted with a series of questions which will help you build your README.md. Most of the questions will require the user to type out their input, however they will be given the option to select their license from a list of common licenses which will then be used to generate badges for their README. Once completed the README file will be generated and saved within the same repository.
